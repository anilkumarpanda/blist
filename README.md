# Blog List
List of blog to follow.

## Use Case
This repository resolves the following pain points:

1. Interesting blogs to follow : Many a times, while browsing the internet I come across a website/blog that is interesting. I also want to discover more content by the author. I save the url, subscribe it or save it in pocket. I move on to another link and never visit it again.

2. Long form content : I want read more longform content, not tweets threads, but long form content. However there are two challenges :

* a) Websites have thier own content and I may or may not like everything they publish. E.g [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/) has amazing tech news, but I am really not intrested in the [NES 64 â€“ Commodore 64 Kernal and Basic ROMs Ported to the NES](nesdev.org)
* b) No website caters content that I really like.

So I aim to resolve these issues 

## Solution Design

Simple(ugly) Streamlit app, that has link of all websites/blogs that I like.
